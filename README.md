# 🚇Subway Network Visualisation with Overpass API, Networkx and Folium

Explore and visualize subway networks from various European cities using data extracted from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This project provides an interactive way to analyze public transport systems through NetworkX graphs and Folium maps.

Subway networks are critical components of urban transportation systems. This project combines OpenStreetMap data, NetworkX, and Folium to create:

* Graph-based subway networks to analyze routes and connectivity.
* Interactive maps to visualize subway lines and stations with route-specific colors.

Whether you're a data enthusiast or a transport geek, this project will help you explore public transit systems dynamically.
